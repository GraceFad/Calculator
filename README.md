## General Information
- This project is a simple calcuator package to perform basic add/subtract, divide/mulitply functions and to take the nth root of a number. 
- This project is to apply my knowledge in creating a python package from start to finish, as well as write clean OOP based Python code and testing it



## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.6

## Installation 
### Install from GitHub
To install, run the following command in a terminal/commnd prompt.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/GraceFad/Calculator.git
```

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```


## Functions
